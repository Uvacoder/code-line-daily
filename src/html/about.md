# About Code Line Daily

Code Line Daily is a project made by [Silvestar Bistrović] in his free time. The goal of the project is to highlight the simplicity in the code, the essence, if you will: a single line of code.

## Open-source project

The project is open-sourced, and you are very welcome to add your line of code, fix any bug, report any issue, or suggest any improvement. To add your favorite line of code, you could either use:

- [CMS to submit the line], or
- [GitHub to create a new pull request].

And don't forget to share and follow the project with the community! Code Line Daily is available on [Twitter], [Facebook], and [IndieHackers].
